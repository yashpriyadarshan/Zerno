## ðŸš€ Project Vision

The goal of Zerno is to **build a fully-featured, scalable, and developer-friendly e-commerce platform**. Contributors can help design features that are production-ready, modular, and easy to extend.

We aim to implement:

- **Wishlist & reviews**: Customer interactions and feedback  
- **Support & ticketing system**: Customer support built-in  
- **Analytics & logging**: Event tracking, audit logs, GDPR compliance  
- **Background jobs & notifications**: Async tasks for scalable operations  

We plan to continuously integrate **modern technologies** such as:

- Messaging queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for async processing  
- Redis for caching and fast lookups  
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, GCP, Azure) for media files  
- REST & GraphQL APIs for frontend consumption
